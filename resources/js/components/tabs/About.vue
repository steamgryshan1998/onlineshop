        <h4>Small dreams and big plans</h4>
        <p>ONLINESTORE is the largest online retailer in the country. Since 2005, we have been fulfilling the small
            dreams and grandiose plans of millions of people. You can find literally everything here. We sell at a fair
            price and provide a guarantee, as we believe that online shopping should be as convenient and safe as
            possible. And every time someone clicks "Buy", we understand that we are doing the right thing.</p>
        <h4>Our goal is to be helpful</h4>
        <p>We believe that things exist to make life easier, more enjoyable and kinder. Therefore, the search for that
            very thing should be quick, convenient and enjoyable. We don't just sell home appliances, electronics,
            jewelry or wine. We help you find exactly what you need, in one place and without unnecessary worries, so
            that you don't waste your life searching, but just live happily. Rozetka is a universal answer to any
            request, the beginning of a search and its final stop, a real assistant. Through smart sourcing and honest
            service, we are making our customers' lives a little better right now.</p>
        <h4>Happiness starts with simple things.</h4>
        <p> And we help to find these things: we tell the lovers how to surprise each other; sports motivate never to
            give up and progress faster; economic we give the opportunity to create real comfort. We want you to know
            what you are looking for and to be able to justify your choice. To do this, we shoot video reviews, write
            articles and track new items.</p>
        <h4>To make dreams come true easily</h4>
        <p>We open huge offline stores so that you can come, hold in your hands and test the product you like. We want
            us to have the best service in the world, so we train our employees not only on the technical side of work,
            but also on working with a client. And if, on the contrary, you want to communicate less with people - for
            this we have parcel machines: you made an order, chose a parcel machine, took you on your way home or to
            work. Everything.</p>
        <h4>Convenient delivery</h4>
        <p>And of course, any product can be ordered with delivery. We deliver within Kiev within one day, and across
            Ukraine - the next day. Everything - without prepayment, if necessary - on credit. Payment in cash or
            non-cash - whichever is more convenient for you.</p>
        <h4>Further more</h4>
        <p>We want our clients to never have the question “where to find something they need”. Therefore, now we are not
            only the largest online retailer, but also a platform for sellers. Someone will start their first business
            with us (or expand the existing one), and someone will bring to Ukraine products that are not yet available.
            This is beneficial to everyone: buyers, sellers, and even us - because in this way we will help more people
            become a little happier.</p>
